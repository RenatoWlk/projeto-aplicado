# Applied Project I - [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/4vidas-red?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hamzamohdzubair/redant)

Repository for the Applied Project I. A web application developed using Spring Boot and Angular called 4vidas (four lives).

## Description

**Quatro Vidas** is a web platform focused on promoting blood donation, connecting donors, blood banks, and partners. The system allows the registration of different user profiles, enables the monitoring of donation history, blood levels in regional banks, and facilitates scheduling future donations through a personal calendar.

The application features an interactive dashboard, an achievement-based reward system, campaign publications, and a map to locate nearby blood banks. Developed with usability and accessibility in mind, the system uses Angular for the frontend, Java with Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.
